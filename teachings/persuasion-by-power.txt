Scott once wrote that persuasion has varying degrees of power. It went something like:

1. Identity. If you can tie someone's identity into persuasion, you'll go far.

Example would be implying that people who are like the subject of your persuasion already do whatever you are trying to persuade them to do.

Or that the person they *aspire* to be would agree with or do whatever you are trying to persuade them to do.

1. Fear

1. Visuals

4. Repetition

5. Social proof

6. Liking

7. Pacing and leading

I edited it to put Fear, visuals and identity tied for #1 because they are all so powerful.

We can also say what doesn't work, or, what is bound to fail: Facts, reasons, logic.

All of the principles are powerful, so ranking them doesn't really mean much. The only thing is to avoid anti-persuasion, which would be, for instance, driving someone further into their own opinion. You can do that accidentally.
