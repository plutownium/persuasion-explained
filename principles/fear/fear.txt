It might be the case that fear is the "real", core cause of everything we do.

Hence the other principles are really just derivations of fear in some way.

Liking: Fear of losing in some way w/ a person you like.

Social proof: Fear of defying the group.

Fear itself: Of loss, of death, of harm.

Anyway, once you indicate a scary outcome associated with maintaining the current state, or with *avoiding* the desired state, you persuade.

To avoid beating the example of car sales to death, let's choose something else.

You might want a family member to do the dishes. Say, your spouse.

"I dunno honey, the Millers next door [who just divorced] told me that the whole thing started over a disagreement about who should do the dishes. I asked [such and such relationship expert] and he said the same thing the Millers said, which was that the right move would've been to just establish early on, you know, 'I'll do it Saturday Sunday, you do it the rest of the week because you get home early.' Like, wouldn't it be better to just take care of this task some people manage to enjoy as like, a therapeutic time for themselves, and take care of it now before it turns into something bad later?"

I layered about five techniques in there. It's primarily fear, then fear, and then more fear.
