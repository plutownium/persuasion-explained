Repetition is probably the easiest principle to apply. If you repeat a fact every day you'll get nowhere. But repeating a persuasive statement is gold.

This explanation belongs in another folder but, essentially after a certain threshold of repetitions, your mind's filtering mechanism just gives up and accepts something as true.

Ideally you repeat something that will cause confirmation bias. I don't think it's possible to use repetition to convince someone that the sky is a unique shade of red that only they can see. They'd never pick up social proof from anyone else reporting similar. A fear persuasion plus repetition would be ideal. Layer in more techniques if possible, of course.
