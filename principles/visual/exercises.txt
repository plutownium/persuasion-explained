Given that this is so early, I have no idea what a great set of exercises really looks like.

All I know is that it's an exercise you can do on your own or with an *easily creatable* environment.

Example:

1. Choose something you'd like to persuade someone to think or do. Write out five examples of how you could make it visual.


2. Now find someone to persuade to think whatever you chose in step 1. Test your examples and see how the subject responds.

3. Remembering your trial's results, adjust your examples.

(This is the beginning of a framework for persuasion, it seems...)

Further exercises could involve combining multiple elements into one sentence or routine.
