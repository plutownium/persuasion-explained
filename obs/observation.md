### Lyin' Ted chapter.

The Slight Bit of Wrongness

If you can make someone pause on a thought, grabbing their attention and directing it to something persuasive, the persuasion gains power. Because their mind was on top of it for a little bit longer. It shifts their rationalizations towards it, I think.

"An engineered mental pause for persuasion. Trump wants you to pause on the choice of Lyin' vs Lying."

Thinking Past the Sale

Because you spend an extra second thinking about the Lyin Ted label, you go past the sale of whether he is a liar or not.

Trump chose nicknames that would create confirmation bias in the future.

ted looks like a liar. physiognomy.

provocative.

### Lil marco Rubio chapter: superb persuasion engineer.

Lil is a negative word on its own. Lil could apply to a lot of Rubio's characteristics. Rubio was shorter than Trump.

Rubio is young for a politician.

Physical size is a leadership quality. We see little as a negative word on its own. But Rubio was smaller than Trump.

### Crooked Hillary

Fresh word for the domain.

Makes her posture sound crooked - visual.

Confirmation bias: Lots of opportunities to remind voters that there was something "crooked" about her.

Crooked is a high ground maneuver: voters disagree on policy but everyone agrees, a crooked POTUS is a bad idea.

### Pocahontus

Visual in the sense that you can imagine Warren in NA garb when you hear it. Contrast between imagination and reality.

Fresh insult for politics. Reminds voters of alleged truth problems. Was easy to meme and the silliness made Warren less serious.

Imagination vs reality made it hard to take it seriously. "Goofy" works along the same lines.

### Clinton's Nickname Failures

...empty of persusion...

Drumpf: unusual name, which is good, but on its own it's null.

"Donald Duck": reinforcing that Trump was avoiding opening up his taxes. But comparing Hitler-In-Waiting to the lovable Donald Duck would be anti-persuasion.

## Big chapter: How to Use Visual Persuasion

Use visual language to describe why someone should act. Visual is far stronger than reason.

### Example: The Wall

Immigration control is a weaksauce concept. So Trump sold us a big beautiful wall. He repeated it too, until we pictured it. We got into making pictures of walls on media.

Persuasion tip 19: You don't need a physical picture if you can make someoen imagine the scene.

The Wall is simple, memorable, and visual.

Makes you think past the sale. We had imagined it so often and debated its cost.

People automatically gravitate towards the future they imagine most often and most vividly.

Trump was vague abotu the wall's details so we could fill in the vagueness however we wanted. Imaginary walls are hard to criticize. Everyone can have their own version.
