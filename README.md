# persuasion-explained
not for code; this is actually a text course for persuasion in the making.

the deal is, if you contribute, it'll always be accessible to you.

If you just want to read it and do the exercises, you are welcome to. feedback is appreciated; the intent is to make persuasion apprentices into more 'masterful' persuaders.

The name of the game is to both consciously understand persuasion (if you want to), learn to spot it (if you want to), and be able to manifest it in your own behavior.

### explanations

some techniques are explainable using logic. others require referencing social context. Others still depend on believing things that seem a bit like voodoo.

Either way, the intent is to have an "explanation" file for each technique, where there is a textbook-esque explanation. How does it work, why does it work, how did it come to be that we are like this? etc.

### the technique itself

the technique should be explained, ideally with a "simplified" version, perhaps cut and pasted with references from Win Bigly, and then an "advanced" section where nuance is included.

### exercises

we're gonna want exercises! Ideally, an exercise is: 

(1) something you can repeatably do *without* putting great effort into creating some difficult-to-create scenario for practice.

(2) something you can *measure*. did the muse for your persuasion switch opinions? Adopt a new behavior? Visibly feel a certain way? Fork over a fat stack of money?

### examples

real world examples of persuasion. Hypothetical (imaginary) ones may be useful for demonstration.


# The Feature Creep Rule

Over time, the effectiveness of Adams's teachings *will* be polluted *if* the program allows "contributions" or "advancements" in persuasion to be added over time.

This would be the wrong move, a pattern to be *avoided*, and I'll tell you why:

Scott's teachings work, plain and simple. The same can be said for the principles of copywriting and in-person selling. What works well today *will also work* in 2400 A.D.

So it would be a mistake to try to expand on what Scott teaches. He already knows what works and told us precisely what those workings are; don't change it.

I will do my best to identify  the best ways to acquire the specific skills Scott promotes and add them here as exercises.

In sum: NO FEATURE CREEP. Don't add to the scope of the texts. If it isn't in Win Bigly, Influence, Impossible to Ignore, and the other Persuasion Reading List texts, we won't be adding it. (I will veto this as necessary.)
