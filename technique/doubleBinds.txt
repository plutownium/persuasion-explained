I put this here in technique though it also belongs in principles.

A double bind is a frame where you have to ways to win. Either side of the bind causes you a win.

Example from Cernovich, which he whipped up on the fly as a joke: "Do you hate Israel like McMaster?" Note this is a butchering, he probably said something slightly different. It was during an interview.

Classic from Erickson: "Will you ______ now or wait?" Something like that.

There's more good ones.
