This isn't a persuasion principle, but you really need to know this as part of your foundation.

All human minds have an unconscious preference for incoming info, such that contradictory interpretations of incoming info are actually impossible for the person to perceive correctly.

It seems possible that you can detect your own bias to a degree, but only a particular bias. And a bias would likely defy being described precisely by words, except in highly general terms.

However, it seems persuasion can "pierce" the mind's biases.
